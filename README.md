# 🌞 LDR-Servo-Tracker
This project demonstrates a light-tracking system built with Arduino, LDR (Light-Dependent Resistor) sensors, and servo motors. The system detects the direction of a light source and adjusts the servos accordingly, simulating a solar tracker or automated spotlight system. It provides a hands-on example of sensor-based feedback control, making it ideal for IoT or robotics applications that interact with the environment in real-time.

# ✨ Features
Precise Light Detection: Four LDR sensors arranged to capture light direction for accurate tracking.
Servo-Controlled Pan-Tilt Movement: Dual-axis movement with two servo motors enables both horizontal and vertical tracking.
Adaptive Sensitivity: Adjustable tolerance and delay settings for stable, smooth movements without overreacting to sudden light changes.
Arduino-Powered: Utilizes Arduino Uno’s analog inputs for sensor data and PWM outputs for servo control, providing easy customization.
